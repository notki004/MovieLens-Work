    "### This notebook demonstrates my research for the MovieLens group where we try to connect movie tags to movie recommendation. The overall end goal of this project is to be able to recommend movies based on which tags the users on the MovieLens website are having a positive interaction with. This means that a user puts a \"+1\" for that tag on that specific movie. "

    "### Question That is Being Asked: \n",
    "     What is the meaning of the valence/total Application of tags in the database?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings: \n",
    "    From what I've found in the databases, it appears that when diving deeper into specific tables, the meaning behind numNuetral, numPosiitve, and numNegative is the number of possibilities of effects for each tag. That means that there is only one option for each which means you felt neutral, positive, or Negative for each tag. I tried selecting the counts for what affect through the tag_events table. I believe that this is just the total amount of times that the affect was used for all tags in all of the movies. I'm not exactly sure if this is the correct interpretation of what I was trying to do, or whether or not this is what Daniel had asked for at the last meeting, but this is how I understood it. I would love it if somebody from the last meeting would give me feedback on whether or not this is correct. \n",
    "### Proposal for Moving Forward: \n",
    "    I think that moving forward, it would be interesting to move forward with the idea of figuring out how we can suggest movies based on how users are using the affect on tags. For example, if a user puts a +1 for a tag, then we can use that in-time data to affect the \"we think you'd like these movies\" section of the website and then it would give movies with that exact tag or similar tags. If a user puts a -1 for a tag then we would find movies that have tags that are opposite of that tag that the user didn't like. If a user uses the neutral affect on the tag then there would be no effect on which movies are recommended. "

    "##### What if we looked at not only the tags in general but maybe tried to look at more specifically the tags throughout specific genres? We could try to see if there is similarity in tags for example between actors, themes in movies, or other types of tags in specific genres of movies. Then we could try to recommend movies to users who liked movies in that genre based on the tag that they liked. For example, say John Doe was a tag for one of the movies and then the user puts a \"+1\" for that tag. Then on the homepage, there could be a section that loads other movies of that genre containing that John Doe tag. I think we have usable the data for this as we have the movie genre data and the tag data in our database. With that data, we can essentially loop through all the different active movies throughout the different genres using real-time user interactions with tags to keep updating the homepage with different tags.
